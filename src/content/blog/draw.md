# üé® Drawing  

Drawing has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. Everything I know, I have learned through practice, experimenting with different techniques, and constantly challenging myself to improve. Because I am self-taught, I understand the learning process deeply‚ÄîI know the struggles of starting from scratch, the patience it takes to refine a technique, and the importance of breaking down each step. This is why I am confident in my ability to teach drawing in a way that is clear, accessible, and engaging for beginners.  

I specialize in both *traditional* and *digital drawing*, each requiring a unique approach but following the same fundamental principles of structure, shading, and lighting.  

## ‚úèÔ∏è Traditional Drawing  
When I draw with graphite or charcoal, I follow a structured process that helps bring depth and realism to my artwork:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ *The Sketch* ‚Äì Every drawing begins with a light sketch, where I focus on the basic structure and proportions. This is the foundation, ensuring the composition is balanced before adding details.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ *Defining the Shapes* ‚Äì Once the structure is set, I refine the lines and begin shaping the features, paying attention to symmetry and flow.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ *Shading and Shadows* ‚Äì This is where the drawing gains depth. Using different pencil pressures and blending techniques, I create soft gradients to simulate light and shadow. I carefully observe where the darkest and lightest areas are, making sure the contrast enhances the realism.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ *Highlights and Texture* ‚Äì The final step is adding highlights and refining textures. I use erasers to lift highlights and create volume, and fine lines to add texture (such as hair, skin details, or fabric). This stage brings the drawing to life, making it feel more dynamic and expressive.

## üé® Digital Drawing  
Digital drawing offers endless possibilities, allowing me to experiment with colors, layers, and brushes in ways that are not possible with traditional mediums. While the process is similar, there are some key differences:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ *Base Sketch & Layers* ‚Äì I start with a rough sketch, keeping it on a separate layer to make adjustments easily. This flexibility allows for cleaner linework and better composition.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ *Line Art & Refinement* ‚Äì Once the sketch is complete, I refine the lines or directly paint over them, depending on the style I want to achieve.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ *Color Blocking & Shading* ‚Äì Instead of shading with a pencil, I use soft and hard brushes to build up shadows and highlights. The ability to work with multiple layers helps in creating smooth blends and textures.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ *Final Touches & Lighting Effects* ‚Äì Digital tools allow for unique lighting effects, blending modes, and color adjustments that enhance the final piece. This is where I add details, adjust contrasts, and refine textures to give the artwork a polished look.

In this section, you‚Äôll find examples of both my *traditional and digital* artwork, showcasing my versatility and the different techniques I use. My goal is not only to create detailed, expressive drawings but also to help others learn, explore, and grow in their own artistic journey.
