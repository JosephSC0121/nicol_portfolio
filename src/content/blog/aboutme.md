# üåç About Me  

Enthusiastic, kind, adventurous‚Äîthose are just a few words that describe me. Ever since I was a child, I‚Äôve been drawn to the beauty of nature and the thrill of exploration. Whether it was climbing trees, running through open fields, or setting up makeshift camps in my backyard, I always found joy in discovering new places and immersing myself in the world around me. That love for adventure has stayed with me to this day‚ÄîI enjoy hiking, camping, and embracing the simple yet profound experiences that come from being outdoors.  

But beyond my love for nature, what truly drives me is *human connection*. I deeply value the relationships I build, whether through friendships, shared experiences, or meaningful conversations. Every person I meet has a unique story, and I believe that learning from others enriches our own perspectives. This is why I am always seeking new experiences, new places, and new people‚ÄîI want to understand different ways of seeing the world and, in return, share a little bit of my own.

## ‚ú® My Passion for Art & Teaching  

Art has always been my way of expressing myself, of capturing emotions and moments that words sometimes cannot. It is through *drawing and painting* that I have learned patience, discipline, and the beauty of continuous learning. Everything I know, I have learned through practice, and I firmly believe that the best way to master a skill is by *immersing yourself in it completely*.

This love for learning naturally led me to *teaching. There is something incredibly fulfilling about sharing what I know and seeing others grow and discover their own artistic voice. Teaching is not just about instructing‚Äîit‚Äôs about inspiring, guiding, and creating an environment where creativity can flourish. That‚Äôs why I am excited about opportunities that allow me to combine my passions for **art, education, and human connection*.  



## üåé Why I Want to Travel & Teach  

For me, *art is universal‚Äîit transcends language, culture, and background. Teaching art while traveling would allow me to not only share my knowledge but also learn from others, exchanging ideas and techniques across different cultures. I want to experience the world not as a spectator but as an active participant, **immersing myself in new perspectives, traditions, and ways of life*.

Whether it‚Äôs through creating something with my hands, sharing a story, or simply sitting around a campfire with new friends, I believe that every experience shapes who we are. I am excited for the journey ahead‚Äîto teach, to learn, and to connect with people in meaningful ways.
