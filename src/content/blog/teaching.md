# üìö Teaching Experience  

Teaching has always been a meaningful part of my journey, not just as a skill, but as a way to connect with others and help them grow. My experience working with children and mentoring students in the arts has shaped my understanding of *education, creativity, and group management*.  

## üåü Pedagogical Volunteering  

One of my most formative teaching experiences was my *pedagogical volunteer work, where I taught **6- and 7-year-old children* a variety of subjects, including *mathematics, Spanish, arts, and dance. Given their young age, I focused on **art-based learning activities* that helped them develop both *fine motor skills and cognitive abilities. Whether it was through **drawing exercises, crafts, or rhythmic movement*, every lesson was designed to be engaging, interactive, and developmentally appropriate.  

This experience was not just a personal choice‚Äîit was a fundamental part of my *high school‚Äôs pedagogical curriculum. I graduated from a **pedagogical-focused high school, which means I received extensive training in **child development, teaching methodologies, and classroom strategies* from an early stage. Through this, I gained *a deep understanding of how children learn best* and how to adapt lessons to different learning styles.

## üéì University Studies & Further Training  

Currently, I am pursuing a *degree in Language Teaching, which has further reinforced my **knowledge of pedagogy and classroom management. As part of my academic training, I have completed **teaching practicums, where I‚Äôve had hands-on experience applying educational theories in real classroom settings. These practicums have helped me refine my skills in **lesson planning, student engagement, and behavior management*, making me more adaptable to different teaching environments.

## üé® Art Mentorship & Teaching Through Creativity  

In addition to formal teaching experiences, I have also mentored students in *arts education. I have conducted **one-on-one and small group sessions* where I guide students through the fundamentals of drawing and painting, helping them develop both *technical skills and artistic confidence. My approach is always hands-on, allowing students to explore different techniques while encouraging their **individual creative expression*.

## üèõÔ∏è Current Work Experience  

Beyond structured educational settings, my work experience has given me valuable insights into *how to engage children through dynamic activities. In my current role, I am **responsible for developing and leading activities for children* in an interactive learning environment. This position has further strengthened my ability to:  

‚úÖ *Plan and execute engaging activities* that cater to different age groups.  
‚úÖ *Foster creativity and problem-solving* through hands-on experiences.  
‚úÖ *Manage groups effectively*, ensuring that children remain engaged while also maintaining a structured learning atmosphere.

Through all of these experiences, I have developed a *strong foundation in education, creativity, and leadership. Teaching is more than just imparting knowledge‚Äîit‚Äôs about **inspiring curiosity, nurturing growth, and creating meaningful connections* with students. I am passionate about *continuing to develop these skills* and sharing my love for learning in new and exciting environments.
